A Worldwide Problem?
According to Wikipedia, “Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.” In simpler terms Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that every IT company stores. However it is becoming almost impossible for them to process, share, store, and search that data.What is the biggest anxiety of the various companies world across? It is how to manage BIG Data!
 
It is becoming almost impossible for the large companies to store, retrieve and process data which is ever-increasing. If any company gets hold on this, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success. The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news this…Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has since become an implicit standard for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving  hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

Apache Hadoop! A Solution for Big Data!
Hadoop is an open source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Hadoop is licensed under the Apache v2 license. It is therefore generally known as Apache Hadoop. Hadoop has been developed, based on a paper originally written by Google on MapReduce system and applies concepts of functional programming. Hadoop is written in the Java programming language and is the highest-level Apache project being constructed and used by a global community of contributors. Hadoop was developed by Doug Cutting and Michael J. Cafarella. And just don’t overlook the charming yellow elephant you see is basically named after Doug’s son’s toy elephant!BiG Data!

A Worldwide Problem?
According to Wikipedia, “Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.” In simpler terms Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that every IT company stores. However it is becoming almost impossible for them to process, share, store, and search that data.What is the biggest anxiety of the various companies world across? It is how to manage BIG Data!
 
It is becoming almost impossible for the large companies to store, retrieve and process data which is ever-increasing. If any company gets hold on this, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success. The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news this…Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has since become an implicit standard for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving  hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

Apache Hadoop! A Solution for Big Data!
Hadoop is an open source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Hadoop is licensed under the Apache v2 license. It is therefore generally known as Apache Hadoop. Hadoop has been developed, based on a paper originally written by Google on MapReduce system and applies concepts of functional programming.
